# example configuration file 

# DATA is specified as type {PE,JUMP,OTHER} and 5 fields:
# 1)two_letter_prefix 2)mean 3)stdev 4)fastq(.gz)_fwd_reads
# 5)fastq(.gz)_rev_reads. The PE reads are always assumed to be
# innies, i.e. --->.<---, and JUMP are assumed to be outties
# <---.--->. If there are any jump libraries that are innies, such as
# longjump, specify them as JUMP and specify NEGATIVE mean. Reverse reads
# are optional for PE libraries and mandatory for JUMP libraries. Any
# OTHER sequence data (454, Sanger, Ion torrent, etc) must be first
# converted into Celera Assembler compatible .frg files (see
# http://wgs-assembler.sourceforge.com)

PARAMETERS
#this is k-mer size for deBruijn graph values between 25 and 101 are supported, auto will compute the optimal size based on the read data and GC content
GRAPH_KMER_SIZE=auto
#set this to 1 for Illumina-only assemblies and to 0 if you have 1x or more long (Sanger, 454) reads, you can also set this to 0 for large data sets with high jumping clone coverage, e.g. >50x
USE_LINKING_MATES=1
#this parameter is useful if you have too many jumping library mates. Typically set it to 60 for bacteria and something large (300) for mammals
LIMIT_JUMP_COVERAGE = 300
#these are the additional parameters to Celera Assembler.  do not worry about performance, number or processors or batch sizes -- these are computed automatically. for mammals do not set cgwErrorRate above 0.15!!!
CA_PARAMETERS = ovlMerSize=30 cgwErrorRate=0.15 ovlMemory=8GB
#minimum count k-mers used in error correction 1 means all k-mers are used.  one can increase to 2 if coverage >100
KMER_COUNT_THRESHOLD = 1
#auto-detected number of cpus to use
NUM_THREADS= 56
#this is mandatory jellyfish hash size
JF_SIZE=10000000000
#this specifies if we do (1) or do not (0) want to trim long runs of homopolymers (e.g. GGGGGGGG) from 3' read ends, use it for high GC genomes
DO_HOMOPOLYMER_TRIM=1
